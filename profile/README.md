# Scientific and Industrial Machine Learning Laboratory (SIMLab)

The Scientific and Industrial Machine Learning Laboratory (SIMLab) at [HES-SO Valais](https://www.hevs.ch) focuses on developing and applying machine learning (ML) techniques to solve complex problems in close collaboration with both academic and industrial partners.
We have a strong emphasis on practical applications and ensuring the real-world impact of our research.

## Research Areas

We specialize in several key areas of machine learning and data science:

- **Differential Programming**: an natural extension of neural networks to more general differentiable programs, enabling the integration of domain knowledge and complex structures into learning models using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **Advanced Data Processing**: we specialize in handling large-scale and complex datasets using state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies, such as [Polars](https://pola.rs>), to ensure efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Hybrid Modeling**: using differential programming methods, we combine data-driven approaches with traditional simulations to leverage the strengths of both methodologies, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: developing techniques to assess and manage uncertainty in machine learning models, enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world. Tools: [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc).
- **Dynamical Systems**: developing methods for analyzing, modelling, and forecasting complex dynamical systems, with applications in energy and environmental monitoring. Tools: [Diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/), [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: we develop machine learning models that are transparent and interpretable, allowing users to understand and trust the decisions made by these models. Tools: [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **Agentic AI**: we develop autonomous systems capable of making decisions and adapting to dynamic environments, with applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart systems. Tools: [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
