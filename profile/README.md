# Welcome to the Github repository of the Scientific and Industrial Machine Learning Laboratory (SIMLab)

The Scientific and Industrial Machine Learning Laboratory (SIMLab) at [HES-SO Valais](https://www.hevs.ch) focuses 
on developing and applying machine learning (ML) techniques to solve complex problems in close collaboration with 
both academic and industrial partners.

We have a strong emphasis on practical applications and ensuring the real-world impact of our research.

## Core Areas

We specialize in several key areas of machine learning and data science:

- **Differential Programming**: we heavily rely on general differentiable programs, enabling the integration of
  domain knowledge and complex structures into learning models using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **Advanced Data Processing**: we specialize in handling large-scale and complex datasets using state-of-the-art
  technologies and methodologies, such as [Polars](https://pola.rs>), scaling data processing pipelines to very
  large-scale datasets.
- **Hybrid Modeling**: using differential programming methods, we combine data-driven approaches with traditional
  simulations to leverage the strengths of both methodologies, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: developing techniques to assess and manage uncertainty in machine learning models,
  enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world. 
- **Dynamical Systems**: developing methods for analyzing, modelling, and forecasting complex dynamical systems, with
  applications in energy and environmental monitoring. Tools: [Diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/),
  [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: we develop machine learning models that are transparent and interpretable, allowing users
  to understand and trust the decisions made by these models. Tools: [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
